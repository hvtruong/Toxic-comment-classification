This is a project replicating the Toxic comment classification challenge: https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge

In this project, we train a LSTM model to take Wikipedia comments and classify them as one more more labels: toxic, severe toxic, obscene, insult, threat, identitiy hate based on probabilities.
The classification generated by our model resulted a ROC-AUC score of 0.97621.

There is a video explaining about our data, models and results: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bf7-ekgW50
